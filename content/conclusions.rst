.. challenge:: Make a concept map 

   `Concept maps <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept_map>`__, like the one above, can be 
   useful to organise one's knowledge and help with planning projects.

   Draw a concept map of a project for which you want to use Julia. It can either focus on the 
   scientific/engineering aspects or on the software side, or both.  
   You can use pen and paper or online tools such as `Excalidraw <https://excalidraw.com/>`__.

Where to go from here

The `Julia discourse platform <https://discourse.julialang.org/>`__ is a place to 
search for existing questions and answers and to ask new questions. Core developers 
and experienced Julia programmers are generous with advice and friendly to newcomers. 

There is also an active `Slack workspace/community <https://julialang.org/slack/>`__ 
with over 10,000 members. This is a space to have quick and informal correspondence with 
others in the community.

Interesting blog posts about Julia are posted on the `Julia Forem <https://forem.julialang.org/>`__.

`Julia Computing <https://juliacomputing.com/>`__ organises regular free webinars and sends 
out a regular newsletter with the latest news on Julia.

`JuliaCon <https://juliacon.org/2022/>`__ is organized annually in July and participation 
is free. 

`SciMLCon <https://scimlcon.org/2022/>`__ was organized for the first time in 2022 
and is focused on the development and applications of the Julia-based SciML 
(scientific machine learning) tooling. Participation is free.
